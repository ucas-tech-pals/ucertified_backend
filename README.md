# uCerified Backend:
uCertified is an innovative certification system designed to empower universities to issue enhanced certifications to their students securely. Through our platform, universities can generate and share digital certifications, and individuals can easily verify the authenticity and credibility of these certifications.
## Technologies Used
- PHP Laravel:
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.
- OpenSSL : 
The OpenSSL Project develops and maintains the OpenSSL software - a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication. The projectâ€™s technical decision making is managed by the OpenSSL Technical Committee (OTC) and the project governance is managed by the OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC). The project operates under formal Bylaws. The core library, written in the C programming language, implements basic cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions.

## Features:
1. **Effortless Verification**: With uCertified, verifying certifications is Effortless. You don't need to compare data or scrutinize details. When you use the verification page, the results will clearly indicate whether the certification is verified or not. Look for the "verified" or "not verified" sign in the results for a quick and reliable confirmation.

2. **Batch Verification**: uCertified allows you to validate multiple educational certifications simultaneously. You're not limited to verifying just one certificate at a time, making the process efficient and time-saving.

3. **Flexible Certification Handling**: Certifications issued through uCertified are not confined to our platform. They can be treated like any regular PDF file, which means you can store, share, and use them as needed. Your certifications are at your fingertips and under your control.

4. **High-Level Security**: uCertified takes security seriously. We utilize robust cryptographic protocols to secure certifications, making them tamper-proof and highly secure. This extra layer of security ensures the certificates' integrity, significantly reducing the risk of forgery and fraud.
